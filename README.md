# FlipCoin
Solidity smart contract for a decentralized coin flip betting game using on-chain randomness. Includes ETH betting, payouts, and event logging.
# ü™ô FlipCoin - Simple Decentralized Coin Flip Betting Game

**FlipCoin** is a simple, beginner-friendly decentralized **coin flip betting game** built with **Solidity**.  
Players can wager ETH on **Heads (true)** or **Tails (false)** and instantly win **2√ó their bet** if they guess correctly!  

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of smart contract development, randomness (even if basic), and decentralized game mechanics.

## üéØ Project Description

The **FlipCoin** smart contract allows users to bet Ether (ETH) on a coin toss outcome.  
The flip result is determined using pseudo-randomness derived from block data ‚Äî making it **a great learning project** for beginners exploring Solidity, Ethereum, and blockchain-based gaming.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This version uses on-chain pseudo-randomness (`block.timestamp + block.prevrandao`) which is **not secure** for real betting.  
> It is intended **for educational and demonstration purposes only.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does

1. A player calls the `flip()` function and sends ETH with their transaction.  
2. The player chooses either:
   - **Heads** ‚Üí `true`
   - **Tails** ‚Üí `false`
3. The contract uses simple block data to decide the result.  
4. If the player guessed correctly ‚Üí they automatically receive **2√ó** their wager.  
5. All results are stored and can be tracked through emitted blockchain events.

## üåü Features

‚úÖ **Fully On-Chain Betting** ‚Äî Every action happens on Ethereum  
‚úÖ **Instant Rewards** ‚Äî Winners are paid automatically  
‚úÖ **Event Logging** ‚Äî Every bet is recorded with results  
‚úÖ **Beginner-Friendly Solidity Code** ‚Äî Clean, simple, and easy to understand  
‚úÖ **No Centralized Control** ‚Äî Once deployed, anyone can play
